# Plasticity_radial_menu_builder
A Python script I have been working on that makes building radial menus for Plasticity much easier.


Choose from the list of commands available by either the number associated with the command, or by typing 3+ letters of the command you are looking for, it will then return a refined list that is renumbered.  You can then add as many commands as you wish.

Example:

I am looking to make a radial menu with all the array commands

I can either enter the numbers associated with the 3 available arrays by their number ex 1-3, 1,2,3 or if you only want two of them, 1,3 would chose the first and the last

when you are finished you type the word finished and it will export into the correctly formatted json file for you to drag and drop into Plasticity.

I am sure there are a few bugs which I will iron out as I come accross them.

I hope this helps, enjoy!
